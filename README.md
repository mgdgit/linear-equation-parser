# Linear Equation Parser

An experimental JavaScript project for tokenizing, parsing, and evaluating linear equations.

> [!NOTE]
> The project is still in an early stage. Core parsing logic is already being built, but the interface, error handling, and equation-solving features are not complete yet.

## Overview

This project explores how algebraic expressions can be processed step by step in JavaScript. The current implementation includes equation tokenization, operator ordering with the shunting-yard algorithm, abstract syntax tree construction, and basic evaluation.

## Goals

- Tokenize linear equations and expressions
- Convert expressions into a structured representation
- Build and evaluate an abstract syntax tree
- Continue toward a more complete linear equation solver
